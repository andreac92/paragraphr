# paragraphr
paragraphr is a writing web app designed to help you focus and organize your thoughts while writing.

The first screen consists of an empty document where you can begin writing. You can alter the font and font size. By default, you start in **Normal View**.
If you choose **Focused view**, what you have written disappears from the screen after the completion of each paragraph. This helps to reduce the tendency to re-read what you have already written.

Once you're done, click **I'm ready to edit**.

On the edit screen, your work has been separated into paragraph units. You can rearrange their order, as well as edit the text. Your introductory sentence has been highlighted for each paragraph. This brings attention to your work in two ways:
* Introductory sentences should more or less describe what your paragraph will be about. Can you determine a paragraph's content based on the introduction?
* Introductory sentences should more or less guide the flow of your work. Hide the content of each paragraph by clicking the up arrow. Do your introduction sentences present ideas that flow into the next and build a coherent argument?

You can also modify the font, font size and introductory sentence highlight color.

Once you are done, click **I'm done**

Your final work is displayed, which you can copy and save. Alternatively, you can download a text copy, or continue to access your work through a unique URL that will be functional for the next 60 days.
